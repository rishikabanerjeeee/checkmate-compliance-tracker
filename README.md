A PROJECT MADE BY RISHIKA BANERJEE FROM KJ SOMAIYA SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING UNDER INTERNSHIP AT DELOITTE ( MAY 2025- JULY 2025)
Compliance Intelligence Engine — AI-Powered Regulation Alignment Platform

An AI-powered compliance tool that matches internal controls with regulatory clauses (e.g., GDPR, RBI, ISO 27001), detects semantic gaps, suggests rewrites, and highlights associated risks/fines using LLaMA3 via Groq API.  
Includes Audit Mode, an interactive chatbot, multi-format uploads, and auto-generated Excel reports.
